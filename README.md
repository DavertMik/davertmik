> I'm passionate about development and testing. That's why I created testing frameworks [**Codeception** for PHP](https://codeception.com) and [**CodeceptJS** for NodeJS](https://codecept.io). Both frameworks introduce a simple way on describing tests in BDD manner. That's why writing tests is easy to start and easy to scale for big teams. I **worked full time on open-source** since 2013 polishing my projects. I also worked as tech consultant on test automation and conducted corporate trainings. I speak Ukrainian, English, and Russian. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to learn more! I'm very open person.

### 🤓 I am Developer 

I work as a full stack developer for my company [Testomat.io](https://testomat.io). I ❤️ **Ruby on Rails**, **EmberJS**, **NodeJS**, **PHP**. I have experience with Vue, React, Angular, Laravel, and other cool tools. I work on open-source projects which are trusted by small a big companies accross the globe. My favorite languages: JavaScript, Ruby, PHP (sorry, TypeScript, not yet).

### ✅ My Thoughts on Testing

Testing is essential part of product development. The more we can automate and the less effort we can spend on this - the better is a product. If you don't feel like writing end 2 end or unit tests, probably you just picked the wrong tool for a job! Testing should be easy and fun. Before you start, learn about [different testing levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BUrcmWQUBQ) and check out the tool that fits the best your current setup. Developers should write tests too, don't give all fun to QAs!

### 🤔 What is Testomat.io?

[Testomat.io](https://testomat.io) is my new big journey. This product helps to **make your tests visible**. Currently, automated tests are shown only to developers or QAs. They run on CI, sometimes they pass, sometimes they fail. But does the team know what are those tests actually about? [Testomat.io](https://testomat.io)  is SaaS platform that can import tests directly from source code and to show them to any person in company: from QAs to business analysts and owners. With Testomat.io you can 

* plan new tests
* receive run reports
* work on projects with BDD
* rerun failed automated tests manually
* ... and more!

Btw, **[Testomatio is absolutely free]()** for small teams. [Sign up today](https://app.testomat.io)!
